# Agent State

This file is the first place future agents should read for current repo state. Keep it
short and update it when important repo facts change. Landed/superseded entries rotate
to `docs/history/state-archive.md`.

## Now

- **CROSS-HARNESS REVIEW IS OFF BY DEFAULT** (owner decision 2026-07-26,
  `.agents/decisions.md`). Do not invoke an external reviewer unless the owner explicitly requests
  `codereview`, `review`, `openreview`, or names one for the work. Code still requires an
  owner-approved plan and normal repository verification.
- **THE GREENFIELD RUNTIME REWRITE IS ABANDONED** (owner decision 2026-07-26). The shipped Council
  pipeline remains canonical. Product work continues incrementally through rules, UI, mapping, and
  related improvements. The discarded proposal survives only as historical evidence at
  `docs/history/runtime-greenfield-plan-abandoned.md`; none of its gates or open questions apply.
- **RULES CHAPTERS 1 AND 2 ARE OWNER-SIGNED; THE DECISION QUEUE CONTINUES.** Chapter 1
  (`docs/rules/resolution.md`) and Chapter 2 (`docs/rules/effects.md`, r24 substantive pin
  `6772d33`) are canonical. Chapter 2 closed r28 with zero findings and was signed off
  2026-07-27, enacting its three declared Chapter 1 refinements and closing the D2 catalog-design
  gate. `.agents/review/rules-system-plan-intake.md` owns the remaining decision queue; no rules
  code before a concrete phase and an owner-approved plan.
- **PHASE PT IS APPROVED AND RUNNING; S1.2 AWAITS GATE 3 ONLY.** D3 gate 1 now records one
  persistent character, active in exactly one campaign: mechanics and progression travel; first
  entry fills every missing Stage 1 name or ability binding; returns reuse saved wording exactly and
  translate only newly gained abilities lacking destination wording.
  There are no portability branches or alternate versions. Campaign setting authority is also
  settled in `.agents/decisions.md`: the creator chooses at creation, GM worldbuilding stands,
  and ordinary play has no host/player setting-correction control. Phase PT in `plan.md` owns the
  landed S1.1 history, fixed slice order, remaining-gate routing, and coding assignment.
- **PHASE V CODE IS COMPLETE; THE OWNER VOICE PLAYTEST IS PENDING.** The live contract is one
  campaign-canonical narrator, server-resolved NPC voices, shared host/seat synthesis, and
  save-once replay. `.agents/review/index.md` owns the accepted implementation trail. The phase
  remains open until a real session confirms the voice experience is better.
- **THE OWNER-APPROVED UI BACKLOG REMAINS UNSTARTED, REVERIFIED AT `c0bedb6`.**
  `.agents/review/index.md` owns the exact findings and order; resume at `jt-1`.
- **THE REMOTE TWO-HUMAN MULTIPLAYER PLAYTEST REMAINS PENDING.** App-side seat work is landed;
  connectivity is owner-handled and out of repo scope. Seat isolation must be re-tested whenever a
  field crosses a seat payload, audio, or error boundary.
- **KNOWN PARKED DEFECT, REVERIFIED AT `c0bedb6`:** `map-render.js:142` draws the location title
  as an unclipped SVG `<text>`. A long location name can overrun the canvas; the landed `map-1`
  fix deliberately covered area labels only.

## Next

**NEXT:** Pose Gate 3 from the v3.1 draft one plain question at a time, beginning with whether the
engine needs a structured capability declaration at all. If it does, Gate 3 must then settle its
contents and how it follows forward-only GM worldbuilding. S1.2 starts only after Gate 3 closes.

- Continue the owner decision queue one item at a time from the canonical queue in
  `.agents/review/rules-system-plan-intake.md`.
- The first approved UI backlog slice is `jt-1` (prevent stale cross-campaign Journal responses);
  select it when UI implementation should resume.
- The concrete mapping candidate is the parked location-title overflow defect; draft and approve
  its fix plan before changing code.
- Phase V's pending feel gate is a real voice session with narrator plus multiple NPC lines,
  checking sticky identities, moods/tones, Skip, and shared host/seat delivery.
- For the combined host/seat playtest, configure `ACCESS_SECRET` and `ADMIN_SECRET`, expose the
  server, add the second character, mint its seat, and send that seat token to the other player.

## Blockers

- No product-code defect blocks development.
- Phase PT S1.2 is blocked only on Gate 3; the campaign-setting authority question is settled.
- Broader Chapter 1/2 effect-catalog runtime implementation remains blocked until promoted into
  a concrete owner-approved phase; the D2 catalog-design gate is closed.
- Phase V closure requires the owner's real-session voice verdict.
- Multiplayer network exposure is owner-handled infrastructure.

## Verification

- Automated: `npm test` — green at `c0bedb6` on 2026-07-31.
- Browser: not run during the 2026-07-31 catchup; no trigger surface changed. See
  `.agents/repo-guidance.md` (Verification) for required surfaces and the coverage boundary.
- Guard-proof requirements and anti-vacuity practice live in `AGENTS.md` and
  `.agents/decisions.md`; the codereview playbook applies only when explicitly invoked.
- Live seat verification uses a throwaway store: mint seat → `/api/seat/session` → leak-scan the
  payload. Release/revoke are destructive.
- Desktop shell verification is `cargo build` in `desktop/src-tauri`.
