# Aetheria DM Improvement Plan

**Goal**: Perfect the single-player experience while laying solid architectural foundations for future multiplayer (tabletop-style: multiple characters in one campaign, sequential turns via initiative or round-robin, shared scenes, natural table-talk).

**Core Principle**: Every change must improve *fun* and *feel* like a real GM. Avoid feature creep. Prioritize quality of interaction over new mechanics.

## Phase 0: Clarification & Table-Talk (Highest Priority - Fix the core complaint)

**Problem**: The DM is too "video-gamey". It rushes to resolve actions and struggles with pure questions like "Which goblin is closer? Can I throw my dagger at it?" The `input_kind: "clarification"` path exists in code but is not reliable in practice.

**Concrete Changes**:
- Strengthen the Interaction Agent prompt to be much more conservative about classifying input as `committed_action`.
- Improve the Referee and Final Narration prompts with better few-shot examples of good clarification responses (scene grounding, partial information, "you don't know yet" answers, encouraging more questions).
- Add explicit "scene grounding" output field so the DM is forced to describe the current tactical situation clearly before any resolution.
- Update `validateTurnData` and frontend to handle richer clarification responses.
- Add a "pure question" detection heuristic in `rpg-engine.js` before the full Council pipeline.

**Success metric**: Player can have 3-4 back-and-forth clarification exchanges without the world state advancing or the DM forcing an action.

**Files to change**: `rpg-prompts.js`, `rpg-engine.js`, `rpg-state.js`, `public/app.js` (minor).

## Phase 1: Narration & Scene Quality

- Make narration richer, more atmospheric, and less mechanical.
- Improve scene visualization (replace weak SVG with better procedural generation or hybrid image approach — defer decision until after Phase 0).
- Better handling of NPC voices and relationships in narration.

## Phase 2: Voice of the Council

- Expand current TTS (OpenAI) to support multiple character voices per turn.
- Give the DM a consistent persona/voice style that persists across a campaign.
- Allow emotional tone directives from the Council pipeline to influence TTS parameters.

## Phase 3: Character & Campaign Foundations for Multiplayer

- Improve the `player_characters` / `characters` relationship so a character can be "active" in only one campaign at a time but easily ported.
- Add optional `initiative` stat to characters.
- Add campaign-level `turn_order` array or simple round tracking.
- UI improvements for selecting/switching active character and viewing multiple character sheets.

**Multiplayer end state vision**: Multiple players can join the same campaign (via shared URL + access token). The DM maintains one shared scene description. Players take turns in declared order. Clarification/table-talk works for everyone. Character progression is persistent across campaigns.

## Non-Goals (for now)
- Real-time simultaneous multiplayer
- Full combat grid / tactical combat system
- New AI image generation (unless it emerges naturally from improving visuals in Phase 1)

**Review Process**: After completing each phase, we will test a full play session together, gather feedback, and only then move to the next phase. No code will be merged until it demonstrably improves the playing experience.

**Current Priority**: Begin with **Phase 0 (Clarification/Table-Talk)** as it is the foundation everything else rests on.

This plan will be updated as we learn from implementation and playtesting.
